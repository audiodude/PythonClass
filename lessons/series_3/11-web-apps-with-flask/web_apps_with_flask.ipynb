    "The concept of a \"web app\" is not new. Since the mid-90s, programmers have used things such as [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) scripts written in the [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) language to create dynamic websites. Many oif these applications responded to user input and stored data. CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a standard specifying how the web server ([Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server), [nginx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx)) can pass necessary variables to the script, while reading the output of the script and sending the data back to the client.\n",

Python uses a standard called [WSGI](https://www.toptal.com/python/pythons-wsgi-server-application-interface) (Web Server Gateway Interface) that allows it to separate the concerns of serving web pages from serving dynamic script content. Notice that we don't have to do things like parse the incoming file path directly and route our request accordingly, we just include the `@app.route` decorator. Additionally, common HTTP headers and status codes are handled automatically and we can focus on the parts of our application that really matter, such as rendering the output content."

The parameter should be the last part of the URL and should accept values of either `'year'` or `'month'`. If it's `'year'`, display the year value of the current time. If it's `'month'`, display the month. Remember to use <> in your route decorator so that you can capture the parameter, and specify the parameter name in the decorated function definition. You can reuse the `greeting.html` template, possibly with an empty `greeting`. Also, you can decide what to do if your parameter isn't 'year' or 'month'.\n",

    "GET parameters are used in the case where the web page displays static information about something based on a parameter. So like `https://baseball.example.com/team?name=Red+Sox`. Such a page would show a page about the Boston Red Sox. The page is still dynamic, it's likely pulling information from a database each time it is accessed, and if the data changes in that database it would display different information. It's convenient to use GET params in this case, because someone can send you the link `https://baseball.example.com/team?name=Red+Sox` and you can immmediately see what they saw. This isn't any kind of requirement though, that the page shows the same thing when the same GET params are sent.\n",

    "The other way parameters can be passed to a web app endpoint is `POST` parameters. POST parameters are sent in the \"body\" of the HTTP request (requests can have body sections just like responses). The most obvious example of POST requests is login forms. You don't want someone to accidentally share a link like `https://login.example.com/?user=mikesmith&password=hotguy123`. Additionally, POST params are used more generally when the user is taking an \"action\". By default, web browsers won't re-POST these requests, so they prevent the action from happening multiple times. It would be really silly to have `https://radish.example.com/post?url=foo.com` and have it create a new entry every time that URL is requested, for instance."
