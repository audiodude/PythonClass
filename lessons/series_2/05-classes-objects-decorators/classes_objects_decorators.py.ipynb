The Python interpreter saw the **decorator** called `property`(the @ sign is just how the decorator is invoked) and extended the behavior of the decorated function in some way. In this case, it created a property on the object that has the same name as the function that was decorated. There are lots of built-in Python decorators for various tasks. And we can write our own!\n",

    "Instead, we can use a decorator. Let's see how our decorator would look before we implement it."
