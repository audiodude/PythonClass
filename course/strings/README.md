#### All about strings

Everything we cover in this class can be done from a python repl.  If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can try it out at [repl.it](https://repl.it/site/languages/python3).

A Jupyter notebook containing the slides can be found in the [too-many-formats.ipynb](too-many-formats.ipynb) file.
