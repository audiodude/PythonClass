2018-10-01: ~11 students.  
2 students left because the course was too advanced, 1 left because the course was too slow.
- A course dissecting a python function might help with the first, an overarching challenge might help with the second.
- Can write code, and can change font size on demand should be added to the preparation.
- Too much uninterupted talking about what python types and collections are.  Should start by loading json, then play with the data while covering the information.
- Visualizations for types might be useful for advanced classes.
