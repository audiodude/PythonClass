this lesson is about the python ecosystem and apis across the board, this should clear up a lot of concepts about the stdlib and get people installing 3rd party packages from PyPI with virtualenv and pip. though pre-class should have everyone be able to have those running, staying away from anaconda if possible or knowing how to use it if now

-How do we avoid an installfest? 
-post virtualenv from read the doc's and email well before this class starts   


a little bit more about pip and virtualenv and Ian Bicking, since weâ€™re on the subject of who is behind this software and these related things in software
