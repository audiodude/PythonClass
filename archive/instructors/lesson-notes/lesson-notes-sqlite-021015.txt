Flask Meetup is on third Thursday of every month!

We should use way more flask to interact with things in class. 
One issue: not everyone knows any html.

Fix the SQLite 3 lesson to use the squares of a list of numbers example and schema.
SQLite is embedded in tons of products for tons of uses (android for example).
Add a join statement into this example at the end so people are exposed to a join.

Greg's numbers 1-100 with their squares example is way simpler and better. My office supplies and physics objects are overcomplex for instruction.

Polling the class for installation:
Who is running windows? (installed through cygwin today)
Who is running mac? (manually installed locally by greg?)
Who is running linux? (All were debian based today)

Polling the class (see what difficulty level to bat towards):
Who has used a database?
Who has heard of SQL?
Who has used an INSERT or SELECT statement?
Who has built an SQL schema?
Who has munged data into a database from some sort of other format (csv/json)?

========================================
I didn't organize the module md file in a very intuitive way.  
========================================
1. Before organizing we should give brief background of SQLite3 and pep249 and how this knowledge will server the class in the future.  Why Database? Why SQL? Why SQLite?
2. In the future the document should be rearranged to talk about how databases are organized right after installation.  Installation should definitely come first, get this out of the way!
3. Add bobby tables example to explain why we pass strings in with "insert ?,? into mytable", ('data1', 'data2') (Called: "Exploits of a Mom" xkcd)
4. Database Normalization is a whole field. We should discuss a little bit of this too!


Finally: We should provide a join example. Maybe we could also do a table of cubes and join the table of squares to the table of cubes.
