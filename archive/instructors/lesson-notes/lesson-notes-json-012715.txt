Class Title: JSON Module
Facilitator: Greg A
Date: 012515
These notes are by: Trent R


Exercise Ideas:
===============
    (greg ran this inside jsonlint.com)
    Q: How many json objects are in: [3,4]?
    A: 3 objects.


JSON Lesson:
============

    Add section showing off the Python 2 Library Documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/library/
    This is in the spirit of this being the 'first lesson' for the course.

    Add section on '' versus u'' versus r''  (string types in Python 2).

    Clean up the examples and add greg's examples written during class.

    Add a subsection for requests? Remove requests? Make it more concise? Something needs to get a bit tighter in the documentation so it is more clear.

    Is there a better real world example we could use for the JSON final example (Currently we grab from a github url with a 'raw json string')


Ideas: 
======
    We should do an XML Lesson!



Leads for the future:
