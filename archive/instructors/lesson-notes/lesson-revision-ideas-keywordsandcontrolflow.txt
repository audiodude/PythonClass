========================================
I found this excellent description of many keywords: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#raise
This document covers tons of things called 'simple statements' which at first glance appear to all be keywords.

Here's another similar document for 'compound statements', which is also a bunch of keywords:
https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html

Do these two documents comprise all keywords?
========================================

Also, consider breaking the exception handling keywords out of the control flow, at least as a subset.
The second subset could be 'regular control flow', things like if, elif, else, while, for.
