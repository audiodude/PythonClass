Class Title: Practical Utilities: datetime and os
Facilitator: Teddy McWilliams
Date: 050415
These notes are by: Teddy M


to execute warm-up people certainly need to know dir() and dir(object)
purpose is to know when to view an object in the interpreter, when to refer to the docs and how to find the proper balance


quickly go over inheritance structure, then maybe make notes or improvements on docs 
or call help(datetime.time) to find out signature and instantiate objects
then

CLASSES
    __builtin__.object
        date
            datetime
        time
        timedelta
        tzinfo

note: a couple of the examples need to be fixed and worked out like the sig-to-strftime, its not printing correctly
also the examples/example folder is just an artifact of a script run earlier

the basics of how to read and write signatures in the interpreter and in the docs was also necessary and took too much time

add a basic timedelta example as well

rehearsal needed for special objects and syntaxes for string substitution,
is there a way to convert these into str.format() methods

if class isn't versed in old-style string substitution we will need examples of that

format = "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y"

s = today.strftime(format)
print 'strftime:', s

d = datetime.datetime.strptime(s, format)
print 'strptime:', d.strftime(format)


for problem 1 there are certainly prerequisites even such as int('1998') conversions
list comps are very handy here too and knowing that strings are immutable so that you convert and assign to a variable or write one functional statement


Ideas to extend this lesson:
===========================

right now, this lesson is much too long for people who aren't familiar with python, the datetime section of this session could easily take an entire 2-hour period
