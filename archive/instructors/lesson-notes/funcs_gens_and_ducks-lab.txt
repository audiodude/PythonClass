for practice generators and functional types of programming, duck typing and iterating on things with a "pythonic workflow" it is a good idea to work with text, there are a number of fun applications we can do with this after cleaning the text
-mad libs    pretty much string.replace if we're not doing nltk tagging
-reordering text otherwise, reversing is one possibility
-generating new text based on the corpus
-talking with pyttsx

don't forget major issue of handling unicode crap

lab ideas can be a bit difficult, reiterate concepts learned before, getting each token from a generator, manipulating it in the way that we need and prefer, what NLP or nltk things can we accomplish?

what i know to do with text? have some basic goals, neato things that you can now do with text now that you have programmatic skills?

reversing the text is fun, playing mad libs is also fun, making a bot could be fun. 

input something. have a vocal api with pyttysx? installation and platform support needed for this one though.
