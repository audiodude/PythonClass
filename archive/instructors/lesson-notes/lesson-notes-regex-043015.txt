Exercise Ideas:  going over docs and what characters in language mean
===============
    is regex a programming language   :)    
        no, why?
    what set of character encoding are we working with?
        any as long as your environment ca handle them and are consistent
    including spaces?
        yes

regex Lesson:
============
    
    add time constraints to each segment of the lesson

    may want to redo or refactor the exmaples to be more readable and/or focused on introduced functionality

    include the context of:
        what a match object is, 
        and what a regular expression object is
        string.split()
        re.split()

    keeping track of the what the long variable names
    seems to detract from the practicality of the material itself

    any other caveats on the r' '  or raw string format?

    writing REs can be pretty fun, maybe we should get people writing a few more examples and then convening to write more as a class

    beatles example is great, may take at least 30 mins to complete

    what are the real world applications or scripts that use groupnigs of re?

    include part about what regex can't do such as reverse a string, or move forward and back on indices
        only if we should desire to have that functionality.



    how much of the docs to address? what is best presentation of these functions before applying them to problem
