this lab entails working with apis that are current and more importantly accessible, docs are great, finding out which one to work with is a lerning point, and the same goes for working with a library that either the company did or a good coder did as well. can we find tests? mock tests could tell someone a whole lot. 

to illustrate concepts, especially posting, where else to post data?
