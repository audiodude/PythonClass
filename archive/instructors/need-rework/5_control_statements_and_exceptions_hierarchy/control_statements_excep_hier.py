#Quick Philosophy Notes

#Errors on functions are caused by a functions assumptions about its input are violated
#this is not just type checking! we're only going to concentrate on errors
#that are contained in the language but we could get into file errors, connection errors, disk space errors
#and can you think of others?
#exceptions allow you to move on in your code when you deem it necessary!

#won't exceptions just compound the places in your code where bugs can occur? 
#some say that exceptions are just like Pokemon
#rather the saying to remember is "catch what you can handle"
#your job to know when to except

#defensive coding: expecting the unexpected (and not always excepting it)

#break, continue are used when looping
