Lesson 18 - Unittesting More
- What differentiates this from the unittest lesson?
- How can we make this a more advanced and expanded overview of unit testing frameworks or merge it with lesson 14?
- What do we want to cover? I think we should avoid TDD and stick to 'writing good tests'.
- To that end, do we want to cover a whole module focused on 'writing good tests"? 

Lesson 13 - Games
- Rename lesson to mastermind_project
- Restructure Project outline to give concise definition of mastermind rules.
- Restructure Project outline so it sets a clear goal for the project
- Set a clear goal of using print statements to play the game.
- Restructure "Going Further" section to be more of a 'Extending the game' section for people to do in their free time.

Lesson 9 - Numbers
- Need more real world data and specific examples.
- Need clearer objectives in numpy/scipy
- Need less time in Python numbers since those are only for basic usage.


Lesson XX - Algorithms
- Need to be a specific and simple (not recursive) algorithm in Python
- One that can be implemented in multiple ways through the course.
- Great example is bubble sort / brute force sort.
- Avoid any complex and winding explanations, favoring putting that in additional info.
- Only easily understood, verbalizing code in a lecturey way is hard enough.
- Our goal is to learn Python, so learning algos is cool but we want it to come back to Python idioms or something.
