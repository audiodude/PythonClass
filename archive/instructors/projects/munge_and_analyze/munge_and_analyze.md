### Munge and Analyze
Our goal today is to consider all the patterns we could extract from the NGSL, and use basic Python data structures to extract them and look at them.  This class is really visceral, lets focus on data that we can see and understand as humans.

#### Materials:
- Python 2.7
- A copy of the ngsl.pickle file in this repository (see the lesson folder)
- These types: list, dict, int, string
- The python pickle library (included in every version of Python)

#### Goals:
- Import our pickled ngsl word list back into a Python instance
- Clean the list items to include only acceptable characters (a-z)
- Come up with fine-grained goals for how we will analyze words and letters.

#### Process:
- Decide on the derivative datasets we want to create.
- Write simple scripts to generate them and pickle them.
- Upload the scripts to the folder for this course.
