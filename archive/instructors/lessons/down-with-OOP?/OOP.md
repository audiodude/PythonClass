#OOP, Classes and Class interaction  

######spike: what OOP isn't   
let’s open up our good friend [repl.it](http://repl.it/) and [Scheme](https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmps112/Spring03/languages/scheme/SchemeTutorialA.html) some non-OOP code!        

    let's start with a couple built-in functions
    (print "Hello, " (read) "!")

    now let's define some of our variables   
    (define pi 3.14)

    (define square (lambda (x)  (* x x)))

    (define my_list (list 1 2 3 5))

    (define length
           (lambda (l)
                   (if (null? l)
                          0
                          (+ 1 (length (cdr l))))))     

1. What is OOP? and how does Python implement this paradigm?       
-OOP is when objects have their own data and their own methods that act on the data   
-The Python language is written in C and the built-in objects including the built-in functions that act on objects  
-One could make a pit stop in the docs for a glance at the [python data model](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html)  
-These built-in functions are ultimately called by a '__method__' that is to say a "double underscore" method or "dunder" and then executed in the corresponding C code     
-In order to understand this more need to write our own objects      

    Define Terms:   
    -attribute: data an object contains     
    -method: function an object contains    
    -property: attributes and methods an object contains    

#####exercise 1: syntax and user defined methods by defining a single Playing Card     
Keep in mind the design rule of YAGNI: "ya ain’t gonna need it"

    Class BlahClass(object):
        '''docstring describing class'''
        #class methods go here
        suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
        ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                 "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]

        def __init__(self, anyarg, moreargs): #the initializer for object instance
            '''where we define instance attributes''' 
            self.anyarg = anyarg
            self.moreargs = moreargs

        def instance_method(self):
            return "arbitrary example code " + self.anyarg  

Note: python OOP implementation exposes instance and class attributes, eg: you can get and set easily!
    instance_attr.now_equals(this)  
Why? 
because its Great!
"python is language for consenting adults"

#####exercise 2: adding 'magic' methods aka 'dunder' methods  
Now let's take a look at how to make our object more useful to us with [magic methods](http://rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html)    
    __new__, __del__, __str__, __unicode__, __repr__, __cmp__, __manymanymore__  

-__init__ is an initializer, by the time we hit this we have already contracted the object, thus the object already exists.

-the goal of self is to create that unique instance, the goal of __init__ is to populate that instance with methods and attributes
-we garbage collect an object at the end of its lifecycle we call the __del__ implicitly
--objects such as sockets or file objects might require extra cleanup upon deletion     
-one of the best things about the ability to access these magic methods in our language    is to contract objects that behave like built-in types. __lt__, __gt__ and others, or we could just use the __cmp__!     
#####exercise 3: make a PokerCard class with the functionality of a high or low Ace composition v. inheritance    
See examples/inheritance-v-composition.py

######now how would we make an UnoCard class?
keep in mind that classes are effectively modules in and of themselves  
they are also APIs in and of themselves     
keep YAGNI in mind      

#####exercise 4: user defined objects interacting - write a deck class that contains card objects and has necessary methods to play a fair game of poker    
Discuss design of these objects and then their interaction  

#####exercises beyond: review the callables.py, inherit-from-string.py and context_manager.py in the examples folder.   
When are these necessary and when are they not?     
What does this functionality say about python OOP implementation?
