###Web Scraping with Scrapy

installation: requires third-party module scrapy    

    spike (20 min): look at an example of an html page in the web console,    
    then figure out how to select certain elements of the DOM using XPath in the console
    A browser's Js Console let's you test XPath selectors eg: $x("//img") or $x("//div/tr/text()")    


What is XPath? and [XPath selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/XPath/xpath_syntax.asp) yes, this is w3schools but even MDN links here!
'[XML Path Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath), powerful way of navigating through the DOM of any XML based language documents, such as HTML and XUL' 

note: watch out how you craft your XPath queries, there can be lots of tricky spaces and nuances within the html and tags  

####1. Preparing for Script Integration: let’s see how to get just the information we want back into our core language, python, using our core language, python. (15 min)    
-go to virtualenv with scrapy installed and then get ready to start your scrapy project through a CLI script much like in django    
    scrapy startproject <projectname>   
-briefly examine what we have installed and setup   
-before we actually think about sending out the robots let’s make sure that we know the terms of use and what it says in the robots.txt     
-what page do we want to crawl and how can we navigate to the best results possible if applicable?      
-eg: we want the top python questions: so we type in python to the search on SO and then sort by votes, because the site offers that to us for free
got to check out the domains sorting options as well eg:
'http://stackoverflow.com/questions?pagesize=50&sort=newest'    

####2. Writing Spider within framework (40 min)       
-write the most basic spider for the site that we have already chosen   
-[refer to the docs to find out what these Items and Fields are](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html)     
-Items are containers for the data  
-Fields are metadata in the form of attributes, but are just ‘plain-old’ Python dicts.  
-after assigning a Field we use Item.fields and use the Item object like a typical python dict API      
       
-write the spider with 3 required fields and then writing the xpath with a loop        
-use the shell command to test your xpath if needed     
    scrapy shell <url>  
    --to select use the sel object with the sel.xpath() method  
    sel.xpath("//div")  
-to write spider refer to examples folder or [scrapy's docs](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.24/intro/tutorial.html#intro-tutorial)
-after writing the spider we must deploy it, and why not write to a json file?       

    command to make it into json:   
    scrapy crawl <spidername> -o items.json -t json   OR    
    scrapy crawl <spidername> -o items.csv -t csv   

#### 3. Underlying code: take a step back (20 min)
-what's happening when you write the command       
    scrapy crawl <spidername>      
-what the parse function actually does  
-[knowing how the spiders work](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html)
-how scrapy is async?    
-diff between base spider and crawl spider 
-parse is a keyword         

####4. Pick a new website together and repeat that basic process (:finish)         

####5. Pagination and Pipeline into DB

[Is scrapy worth your time?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6283271/is-it-worth-learning-scrapy) 

Also, scrapy is the most robust in that you can customize is the most if the data you are scraping becomes complicated  

other python scraping libraries: BeautifulSoup, Mechanize, requests, lxml
'Beautiful Soup sits on top of popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib'
scrapy cloud    

[what’s wrong with using regex for html:](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags?page=1&tab=votes#1732454)
regular expressions are for parsing regular languages, html is not a regular language, from there we go into applied automata theory    

web pages are designed as APIs between the html tags and the designers who make and change the css methodically     

there can be bugs in data extraction and data saving such as unicode or ascii bugs
