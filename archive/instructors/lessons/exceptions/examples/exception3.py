"""
Course: Exceptions
Topic:  with... as
Summary: Use 'try... except', the familiar 'open' built-in function, and 'with... as' to demonstrate capturing an exception.
Takeaways: The purpose of  'with... as' is to perform certain actions if the action fails early.  In this case, 'open'
has a context manager which closes the file before returning the exception. We still need to capture the exception.
