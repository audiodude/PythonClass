Hello,

I have been coming to Noisebridge since 2012. In addition to teaching ad-hoc Python classes I co-host [neurohacking sessions](https://noisebridge.net/DreamTeam) on Wednesday nights from 20:00-22:00. For more about us please checkout out our [blog](https://sensorium.space). For more about me have a gander at my Noisebridge wiki user page, [bfb](https://noisebridge.net/user:bfb).
