### Using Python & Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a powerful open source search engine which is easy to use from Python.

In this class we'll use Python to download some freely available texts from
openlibrary.org, and then we'll load those into Elasticsearch to create a
searchable index of content.

After building a text search index, we'll explore some of Elasticsearch's
geographic search capability, and build a small Flask web application which
can tell us the country code for any longitude & latitude we send to it.
