## Tree Search Algorithms

#### About Trees

Trees are an extremely common data-structure in software; they're very
useful for representing hierarchical relationships (like the folders or
directories on your hard disk, or a chart of a large organization's structure).

Most trees like those in the examples above contain no 'order' in the tree;
for example, if I asked you to find a file named 'test.py' on a hard disk, it's
hard to tell just by looking at the folder names where that file will be; you
would have to open a few (or maybe all) of them to find it.  We're going to
write code to do this kind of search automatically - these are called
'tree search algorithms'.

Our algorithms will _traverse_ the tree to find items we're looking for.  The
two most common algorithms for tree traversal are Depth-First Search (DFS) and
Breadth-First Search (BFS), and we'll look at both.


#### Depth-First Search

A depth-first search traversal navigates all the way to the leaf nodes of our
tree.  This is a perfect fit for a recursive function:

* Is the current node the one we are looking for?
* If so, return the current node
* If not, repeat on both the left and then the right children

Let's try to code this up in Python using the file 'exercise.py' which
has an example `tree` and placeholders for our code:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pyenchant
python exercise.py
```
