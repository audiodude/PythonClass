=======
System design is an under taught subject, and REST is a well understood, relatively simple, and frequently used model for how to do that.
[Datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) is an open source application that [embodies](https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/4/datasette-ideas/) many [REST principles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming).
A class that stands up a datasette server according to REST guidelines might be a good unit of instruction.
