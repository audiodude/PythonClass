How does Python change?
=======================
A new version of Python is released every 18 months, adding features, changing the standard library, and generally making decisions.  Before these changes happen, they are written down in Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), complete with rational, specification, alternatives, and decisions.  The PEP is then decided on by the community and stored for posterity.

PEPs are worthwhile as examples of software design, and as indicators of what is important and what is changing in the Python community.


Leading Questions
=================
What peps were implemented for python 3.7?  What parts of python are changing?


Read the PEP for a recently implemented feature (maybe [Data Classes](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/)).  Why is this feature important?  What considerations were taken into account?  What compromises were made?


Read a rejected PEP (maybe [frozendict](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0416/)).  Why is this feature important or unimportant?  Why was it rejected?
