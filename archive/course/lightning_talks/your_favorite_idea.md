What do other people need to know about?
========================================

One of my favorite papers is [Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), by Hadley Wickham, which describes a method of organizing data for ease of analysis.

There is another great set of blog posts on asynchronous code and concurrency by [Nathaniel Smith](https://vorpus.org/blog/timeouts-and-cancellation-for-humans/).

Pick your favorite blog post, or read part of these, and give a pitch for why the ideas are exciting and worthwhile.
